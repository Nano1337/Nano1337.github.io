## SPIE Photonics West 2023 Talk
I'll be giving a 20 minute talk at SPIE Photonics West 2023: Advanced Biomedical and Clinical Diagnostic and Surgical Guidance Systems XXI in San Francisco, CA on January 29, 2023. The title of my talk is "SpecFlow: an end-to-end framework for specular reflection restoration in endoscopy videos using flow-guided video completion". The abstract can be found [here](https://spie.org/photonics-west/presentation/SpecFlow--an-end-to-end-framework-for-specular-reflection/12368-22).
